# Modeling documents

In this chapter, we'll define the domain model for our freight and delivery system and store it in PostgreSQL using Marten as a document database.

## Learning Goals

- Design C# document types (`Shipment`, `Driver`)
- Store documents using Marten
- Query documents using LINQ
- Understand Marten's identity and schema conventions

## Defining Documents

We'll start by modeling two core entities in our domain: `Shipment` and `Driver`.

<<< @/src/samples/FreightShipping/ModelingDocuments.cs#models

> Marten uses `Id` as the primary key by convention. No attributes or base classes are required.

Once defined, Marten will automatically create tables like `mt_doc_shipment` and `mt_doc_driver` with a `jsonb` column to store the data.

## Storing Documents

<<< @/src/samples/FreightShipping/ModelingDocuments.cs#storing-documents

Marten uses PostgreSQL's `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` under the hood to perform upserts.

## Querying Documents

Use LINQ queries to fetch or filter data:

<<< @/src/samples/FreightShipping/ModelingDocuments.cs#querying-documents

> You can also project into DTOs or anonymous types for performance if you donâ€™t need the full document.

## Indexing Fields for Performance

If you frequently query by certain fields, consider duplicating them as indexed columns:

<<< @/src/samples/FreightShipping/ModelingDocuments.cs#indexing-fields

This improves query performance by creating indexes on those columns outside the JSON.

## Visual Recap

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Shipment Created] -->|Store| B["mt_doc_shipment (JSONB)"]
    A2[Driver Registered] -->|Store| C["mt_doc_driver (JSONB)"]
    B -->|Query: Destination = Chicago| D[LINQ Result]
```

## Summary

- Documents are plain C# classes with an `Id` property
- Marten stores them in PostgreSQL using `jsonb`
- You can query documents using LINQ
- Index fields you query often for better performance
