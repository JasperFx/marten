# Aggregate Projections

::: tip
Definitely check out the content on [CQRS Command Handler Workflow for Capturing Events](/scenarios/command_handler_workflow)
and [Reading Aggregates](/events/projections/read-aggregates) to get the best possible performance and
development usability for aggregate projections with Marten. Also see the combination with [Wolverine](https://wolverinefx.net)
in its [Aggregate Handler Workflow](https://wolverinefx.net/guide/durability/marten/event-sourcing.html) for literally the 
lowest code ceremony possible to use Marten within a CQRS architecture.
:::

_Aggregate Projections_ in Marten combine some sort of grouping of events and process them to create a single
aggregated document representing the state of those events. To jump into a simple example, here's a simple aggregated
view called `QuestParty` that creates an aggregated view of `MembersJoined`, `MembersDeparted`, and `QuestStarted` events related to a group of heroes traveling on a quest in your favorite fantasy novel:

<!-- snippet: sample_QuestParty -->
<a id='snippet-sample_questparty'></a>
```cs
public sealed record QuestParty(Guid Id, List<string> Members)
{
    // These methods take in events and update the QuestParty
    public static QuestParty Create(QuestStarted started) => new(started.QuestId, []);
    public static QuestParty Apply(MembersJoined joined, QuestParty party) =>
        party with
        {
            Members = party.Members.Union(joined.Members).ToList()
        };

    public static QuestParty Apply(MembersDeparted departed, QuestParty party) =>
        party with
        {
            Members = party.Members.Where(x => !departed.Members.Contains(x)).ToList()
        };

    public static QuestParty Apply(MembersEscaped escaped, QuestParty party) =>
        party with
        {
            Members = party.Members.Where(x => !escaped.Members.Contains(x)).ToList()
        };
}
```

Once again, here's the class diagram of the key projection types inside of Marten, but please note the `SingleStreamProjection<T>`:

```mermaid
classDiagram

CustomProjection~TDoc, TId~ --|> ProjectionBase
ProjectionWrapper ..|> IProjectionSource
ProjectionWrapper --> IProjection
GeneratedProjection --|> ProjectionBase
GeneratedProjection ..|> IProjectionSource
EventProjection --|> GeneratedProjection

MultiStreamProjection~TDoc, TId~ --|> GeneratedAggregateProjectionBase~T~
MultiStreamProjection~TDoc, TId~ --|> IEventSlicer~TDoc, TId~
```

Marten supports a few different types of aggregated projections:

- **Single Stream Projections** -- creating a rolled up view of all or a segment of the events within an event stream. This is done through either a live stream aggregation, or `SingleStreamProjection<T>` as a base class for your projection or by doing _snapshots_.
- **Multi Stream Projections** -- creating a rolled up view of a user-defined grouping of events across streams. These projections are done by sub-classing the `MultiStreamProjection<TDoc, TId>` class and is further described in [Multi-Stream Projections](/events/projections/multi-stream-projections).

Please note that all aggregated projections share the same set of method conventions described in this page.

## Aggregate by Stream

::: tip
Projection types and the associated aggregate types need to be scoped as public because of Marten's internal code generation techniques. Some methods
discovered by the method conventions can be internal or private, but the holding type must be public.
:::

The easiest type of aggregate to create is a document that rolls up the state of a single event stream. You can do that by either creating a public aggregate
document that directly mutates itself through method conventions or by sub-classing the `SingleStreamProjection<T>` class like this sample for a fictional `Trip` aggregate document:

<!-- snippet: sample_TripProjection_aggregate -->
<a id='snippet-sample_tripprojection_aggregate'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    public TripProjection()
    {
        DeleteEvent<TripAborted>();

        DeleteEvent<Breakdown>(x => x.IsCritical);

        DeleteEvent<VacationOver>((trip, _) => trip.Traveled > 1000);
    }

    // These methods can be either public, internal, or private but there's
    // a small performance gain to making them public
    public void Apply(Arrival e, Trip trip) => trip.State = e.State;
    public void Apply(Travel e, Trip trip) => trip.Traveled += e.TotalDistance();

    public void Apply(TripEnded e, Trip trip)
    {
        trip.Active = false;
        trip.EndedOn = e.Day;
    }

    public Trip Create(TripStarted started)
    {
        return new Trip { StartedOn = started.Day, Active = true };
    }
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

And register that projection like this:

::: tip
Remember to start the Async Daemon when using async projections, see [Asynchronous Projections Daemon](/events/projections/async-daemon.html)
:::

<!-- snippet: sample_registering_an_aggregate_projection -->
<a id='snippet-sample_registering_an_aggregate_projection'></a>
```cs
var store = DocumentStore.For(opts =>
{
    opts.Connection("some connection string");

    // Register as inline
    opts.Projections.Add<TripProjection>(ProjectionLifecycle.Inline);

    // Or instead, register to run asynchronously
    opts.Projections.Add<TripProjection>(ProjectionLifecycle.Async);
});
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/TestingSupport/TripProjectionWithCustomName.cs#L16-L29' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_registering_an_aggregate_projection' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

Any projection based on `SingleStreamProjection<T>` will allow you to define steps by event type to either create, delete, or mutate an aggregate
document through a mix of inline Lambda expressions in the constructor function of the projection class or by using specially named methods on the
projection class. It's completely up to your preference to decide which to use.

Alternatively, if your aggregate will never be deleted you can use a stream aggregation as explained in the last section of this page.

To create aggregate projections that include events in multiple streams, see [Multi-Stream Projections](/events/projections/multi-stream-projections).

## Strong Typed Identifiers <Badge type="tip" text="7.29" />

Marten supports using strong-typed identifiers as the document identity for aggregated documents. Here's an example:

<!-- snippet: sample_using_strong_typed_identifier_for_aggregate_projections -->
<a id='snippet-sample_using_strong_typed_identifier_for_aggregate_projections'></a>
```cs
[StronglyTypedId(Template.Guid)]
public readonly partial struct PaymentId;

public class Payment
{
    [JsonInclude] public PaymentId? Id { get; private set; }

    [JsonInclude] public DateTimeOffset CreatedAt { get; private set; }

    [JsonInclude] public PaymentState State { get; private set; }

    public static Payment Create(IEvent<PaymentCreated> @event)
    {
        return new Payment
        {
            Id = new PaymentId(@event.StreamId), CreatedAt = @event.Data.CreatedAt, State = PaymentState.Created
        };
    }

    public void Apply(PaymentCanceled @event)
    {
        State = PaymentState.Canceled;
    }

    public void Apply(PaymentVerified @event)
    {
        State = PaymentState.Verified;
    }
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/EventSourcingTests/Aggregation/using_guid_based_strong_typed_id_for_aggregate_identity.cs#L138-L170' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_using_strong_typed_identifier_for_aggregate_projections' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

Just note that for single stream aggregations, your strong typed identifier types will need to wrap either a `Guid` or
`string` depending on your application's `StreamIdentity`. 

At this point, the `FetchForWriting` and `FetchForLatest` APIs do not directly support strongly typed identifiers and you
will have to just pass in the wrapped, primitive value like this:

<!-- snippet: sample_use_fetch_for_writing_with_strong_typed_identifier -->
<a id='snippet-sample_use_fetch_for_writing_with_strong_typed_identifier'></a>
```cs
private async Task use_fetch_for_writing_with_strong_typed_identifier(PaymentId id, IDocumentSession session)
{
    var stream = await session.Events.FetchForWriting<Payment>(id.Value);
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

## Aggregate Creation

::: tip
As of Marten 7, if your aggregation projection has both a `Create()` function or constructor for an event type, and
an `Apply()` method for the same event type, Marten will only call one or the other method depending on whether the
aggregate already exists **but never both** for one single event.
:::

Aggregates can initially be created behind the scenes by Marten if there's a no-arg constructor function on the aggregate
document type -- which doesn't have to be public by the way.

You can also use a constructor that takes an event type as shown in this sample of a `Trip` stream aggregation:

<!-- snippet: sample_Trip_stream_aggregation -->
<a id='snippet-sample_trip_stream_aggregation'></a>
```cs
public class Trip
{
    // Probably safest to have an empty, default
    // constructor unless you can guarantee that
    // a certain event type will always be first in
    // the event stream
    public Trip()
    {
    }

    // Create a new aggregate based on the initial
    // event type
    internal Trip(TripStarted started)
    {
        StartedOn = started.Day;
        Active = true;
    }

    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public int EndedOn { get; set; }

    public double Traveled { get; set; }

    public string State { get; set; }

    public bool Active { get; set; }

    public int StartedOn { get; set; }
    public Guid? RepairShopId { get; set; }

    // The Apply() methods would mutate the aggregate state
    internal void Apply(Arrival e) => State = e.State;
    internal void Apply(Travel e) => Traveled += e.TotalDistance();

    internal void Apply(TripEnded e)
    {
        Active = false;
        EndedOn = e.Day;
    }

    // We think stream aggregation is mostly useful for live aggregations,
    // but hey, if you want to use a aggregation as an asynchronous projection,
    // you can also specify when the aggregate document should be deleted
    internal bool ShouldDelete(TripAborted e) => true;
    internal bool ShouldDelete(Breakdown e) => e.IsCritical;
    internal bool ShouldDelete(VacationOver e) => Traveled > 1000;
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/TestingSupport/TripProjectionWithCustomName.cs#L113-L163' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_trip_stream_aggregation' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

Or finally, you can use a method named `Create()` on a projection type as shown in this sample:

<!-- snippet: sample_TripProjection_aggregate -->
<a id='snippet-sample_tripprojection_aggregate'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    public TripProjection()
    {
        DeleteEvent<TripAborted>();

        DeleteEvent<Breakdown>(x => x.IsCritical);

        DeleteEvent<VacationOver>((trip, _) => trip.Traveled > 1000);
    }

    // These methods can be either public, internal, or private but there's
    // a small performance gain to making them public
    public void Apply(Arrival e, Trip trip) => trip.State = e.State;
    public void Apply(Travel e, Trip trip) => trip.Traveled += e.TotalDistance();

    public void Apply(TripEnded e, Trip trip)
    {
        trip.Active = false;
        trip.EndedOn = e.Day;
    }

    public Trip Create(TripStarted started)
    {
        return new Trip { StartedOn = started.Day, Active = true };
    }
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/TestingSupport/TripProjectionWithCustomName.cs#L44-L74' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_tripprojection_aggregate' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

The `Create()` method has to return either the aggregate document type or `Task<T>` where `T` is the aggregate document type. There must be an argument for the specific event type or `IEvent<T>` where `T` is the event type if you need access to event metadata. You can also take in an `IQuerySession` if you need to look up additional data as part of the transformation or `IEvent` in addition to the exact event type just to get at event metadata.

## Applying Changes to the Aggregate Document

::: tip
`Apply()` methods or `ProjectEvent<T>()` method calls can also use interfaces or abstract types that are implemented by specific event types, and
Marten will apply all those event types that can be cast to the interface or abstract type to that method when executing the projection.
:::

To make changes to an existing aggregate, you can either use inline Lambda functions per event type with one of the overloads of `ProjectEvent()`:

<!-- snippet: sample_using_ProjectEvent_in_aggregate_projection -->
<a id='snippet-sample_using_projectevent_in_aggregate_projection'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    public TripProjection()
    {
        ProjectEvent<Arrival>((trip, e) => trip.State = e.State);
        ProjectEvent<Travel>((trip, e) => trip.Traveled += e.TotalDistance());
        ProjectEvent<TripEnded>((trip, e) =>
        {
            trip.Active = false;
            trip.EndedOn = e.Day;
        });

        ProjectEventAsync<Breakdown>(async (session, trip, e) =>
        {
            var repairShop = await session.Query<RepairShop>()
                .Where(x => x.State == trip.State)
                .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

            trip.RepairShopId = repairShop?.Id;
        });
    }
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/TestingSupport/TripProjectionWithCustomName.cs#L169-L194' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_using_projectevent_in_aggregate_projection' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

I'm not personally that wild about using lots of inline Lambdas like the example above, and to that end, Marten now supports the `Apply()` method convention. Here's the same `TripProjection`, but this time using methods to mutate the `Trip` document:

<!-- snippet: sample_TripProjection_aggregate -->
<a id='snippet-sample_tripprojection_aggregate'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    public TripProjection()
    {
        DeleteEvent<TripAborted>();

        DeleteEvent<Breakdown>(x => x.IsCritical);

        DeleteEvent<VacationOver>((trip, _) => trip.Traveled > 1000);
    }

    // These methods can be either public, internal, or private but there's
    // a small performance gain to making them public
    public void Apply(Arrival e, Trip trip) => trip.State = e.State;
    public void Apply(Travel e, Trip trip) => trip.Traveled += e.TotalDistance();

    public void Apply(TripEnded e, Trip trip)
    {
        trip.Active = false;
        trip.EndedOn = e.Day;
    }

    public Trip Create(TripStarted started)
    {
        return new Trip { StartedOn = started.Day, Active = true };
    }
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/TestingSupport/TripProjectionWithCustomName.cs#L44-L74' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_tripprojection_aggregate' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

The `Apply()` methods can accept any combination of these arguments:

1. The actual event type
1. `IEvent<T>` where the `T` is the actual event type. Use this if you want access to the [event metadata](/events/metadata) like versions or timestamps.
1. `IEvent` access the event metadata. It's perfectly valid to accept both `IEvent` for the metadata and the specific event type just out of convenience.
1. `IQuerySession` if you need to do additional data lookups
1. The aggregate type

The valid return types are:

1. `void` if you are mutating the aggregate document
1. The aggregate type itself, and this allows you to use immutable aggregate types
1. `Task` if you are mutating the aggregate document with the use of external data read through `IQuerySession`
1. `Task<T>` where `T` is the aggregate type. This allows you to use immutable aggregate types while also using external data read through `IQuerySession`

## Deleting the Aggregate Document

In asynchronous or inline projections, receiving a certain event may signal that the projected document is now obsolete and should be deleted from
document storage. If a certain event type always signals a deletion to the aggregated view, you can use this mechanism inside of the constructor function of your
aggregate projection type:

<!-- snippet: sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type -->
<a id='snippet-sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    public TripProjection()
    {
        // The current Trip aggregate would be deleted if
        // the projection encountered a TripAborted event
        DeleteEvent<TripAborted>();
    }
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/AggregationExamples.cs#L16-L28' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

If the deletion of the aggregate document needs to be done by testing some combination of the current aggregate state, the event,
and maybe even other document state in your Marten database, you can use more overloads of `DeleteEvent()` as shown below:

<!-- snippet: sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type_and_func -->
<a id='snippet-sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type_and_func'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    public TripProjection()
    {
        // The current Trip aggregate would be deleted if
        // the Breakdown event is "critical"
        DeleteEvent<Breakdown>(x => x.IsCritical);

        // Alternatively, delete the aggregate if the trip
        // is currently in New Mexico and the breakdown is critical
        DeleteEvent<Breakdown>((trip, e) => e.IsCritical && trip.State == "New Mexico");

        DeleteEventAsync<Breakdown>(async (session, trip, e) =>
        {
            var anyRepairShopsInState = await session.Query<RepairShop>()
                .Where(x => x.State == trip.State)
                .AnyAsync();

            // Delete the trip if there are no repair shops in
            // the current state
            return !anyRepairShopsInState;
        });
    }
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/AggregationExamples.cs#L40-L67' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type_and_func' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

Another option is to use a method convention with a method named `ShouldDelete()`, with this equivalent using the `ShouldDelete() : bool` method convention:

<!-- snippet: sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type_and_func_with_convention -->
<a id='snippet-sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type_and_func_with_convention'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    // The current Trip aggregate would be deleted if
    // the Breakdown event is "critical"
    public bool ShouldDelete(Breakdown breakdown) => breakdown.IsCritical;

    // Alternatively, delete the aggregate if the trip
    // is currently in New Mexico and the breakdown is critical
    public bool ShouldDelete(Trip trip, Breakdown breakdown)
        => breakdown.IsCritical && trip.State == "New Mexico";

    public async Task<bool> ShouldDelete(IQuerySession session, Trip trip, Breakdown breakdown)
    {
        var anyRepairShopsInState = await session.Query<RepairShop>()
            .Where(x => x.State == trip.State)
            .AnyAsync();

        // Delete the trip if there are no repair shops in
        // the current state
        return !anyRepairShopsInState;
    }
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/AggregationExamples.cs#L81-L106' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_deleting_aggregate_by_event_type_and_func_with_convention' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

The `ShouldDelete()` method can take any combination of these arguments:

1. The actual event type
1. `IEvent<T>` where the `T` is the actual event type. Use this if you want access to the [event metadata](/events/metadata) like versions or timestamps.
1. `IQuerySession` if you need to do additional data lookups
1. The aggregate type

Additionally, `ShouldDelete()` methods should return either a `Boolean` or `Task<Boolean>` if doing data lookups with `IQuerySession` -- and we'very strongly recommend using strictly asynchronous APIs if running the projection asynchronously or using `SaveChangesAsync()` when executing projections inline.

## Stream Aggregations

You can use the `SingleStreamProjection<T>` method conventions for stream aggregations, which we just mean to be an aggregate document type that implements its own `Apply()` or `ShouldDelete()` methods to mutate itself. Using that concept, let's take the `TripProjection` we have been using and apply that instead to a `Trip` type:

<!-- snippet: sample_Trip_stream_aggregation -->
<a id='snippet-sample_trip_stream_aggregation'></a>
```cs
public class Trip
{
    // Probably safest to have an empty, default
    // constructor unless you can guarantee that
    // a certain event type will always be first in
    // the event stream
    public Trip()
    {
    }

    // Create a new aggregate based on the initial
    // event type
    internal Trip(TripStarted started)
    {
        StartedOn = started.Day;
        Active = true;
    }

    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public int EndedOn { get; set; }

    public double Traveled { get; set; }

    public string State { get; set; }

    public bool Active { get; set; }

    public int StartedOn { get; set; }
    public Guid? RepairShopId { get; set; }

    // The Apply() methods would mutate the aggregate state
    internal void Apply(Arrival e) => State = e.State;
    internal void Apply(Travel e) => Traveled += e.TotalDistance();

    internal void Apply(TripEnded e)
    {
        Active = false;
        EndedOn = e.Day;
    }

    // We think stream aggregation is mostly useful for live aggregations,
    // but hey, if you want to use a aggregation as an asynchronous projection,
    // you can also specify when the aggregate document should be deleted
    internal bool ShouldDelete(TripAborted e) => true;
    internal bool ShouldDelete(Breakdown e) => e.IsCritical;
    internal bool ShouldDelete(VacationOver e) => Traveled > 1000;
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/blob/master/src/DaemonTests/TestingSupport/TripProjectionWithCustomName.cs#L113-L163' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_trip_stream_aggregation' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

Here's an example of using the various ways of doing `Trip` stream aggregation:

<!-- snippet: sample_using_stream_aggregation -->
<a id='snippet-sample_using_stream_aggregation'></a>
```cs
internal async Task use_a_stream_aggregation()
{
    var store = DocumentStore.For(opts =>
    {
        opts.Connection("some connection string");

        // Run the Trip as an inline projection
        opts.Projections.Snapshot<Trip>(SnapshotLifecycle.Inline);

        // Or run it as an asynchronous projection
        opts.Projections.Snapshot<Trip>(SnapshotLifecycle.Async);
    });

    // Or more likely, use it as a live aggregation:

    // Just pretend you already have the id of an existing
    // trip event stream id here...
    var tripId = Guid.NewGuid();

    // We'll open a read only query session...
    await using var session = store.QuerySession();

    // And do a live aggregation of the Trip stream
    var trip = await session.Events.AggregateStreamAsync<Trip>(tripId);
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

## Aggregate Versioning

It's frequently valuable to know the version of the underlying event stream that a single stream aggregate represents. Marten 5.4 added a
new, built in convention to automatically set the aggregate version on the aggregate document itself. The immediate usage is probably to help
Marten users opt into Marten's [optimistic concurrency for appending events](/events/appending.html#appending-events-1) by making it easier to get the current aggregate (stream) version that you need
in order to opt into the optimistic concurrency check.

To start with, let's say we have an `OrderAggregate` defined like this:

<!-- snippet: sample_OrderAggregate_with_version -->
<a id='snippet-sample_orderaggregate_with_version'></a>
```cs
public class OrderAggregate
{
    // This is most likely the stream id
    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    // This would be set automatically by Marten if
    // used as the target of a SingleStreamAggregation
    public int Version { get; set; }

    public void Apply(OrderShipped shipped) => HasShipped = true;
    public bool HasShipped { get; private set; }
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

Notice the `Version` property of that document above. Using a naming convention (we'll talk about how to go around the convention in just a second),
Marten "knows" that that property should reflect the latest versioned event within the individual stream encountered by this projection. So if
there have been 5 events captured for a particular stream and all five events have been processed through the projection, the value of the `Version`
property will be 5.

There are of course some restrictions:

- The version member can be either a field or a property
- The getter can be internal or private (but the mechanics are a tiny bit smoother with a public setter)
- The version member can be either an `int` (Int32) or `long` (Int64)

Marten determines whether a member is the version of the aggregate by first finding all public members
of either type `int` or `long`, then running down these rules:

1. A member marked with the `[Version]` attribute will override the naming convention
2. Look for an member named "version" (it's not case sensitive)
3. **But**, ignore any member marked with `[MartenIgnore]` in case "Version" has a different meaning on your aggregate document

## Using Event Metadata in Aggregates

All the previous examples showed `Apply` / `Create` / `ShouldDelete` methods that accepted
the specific event type as the first argument. If there is a need for accessing the
event metadata (timestamps, causation/correlation information, custom event headers),
you can alternatively accept an argument of type `IEvent<T>` where `T` is the actual event type (do this in
place of the event body) or by accepting an additional argument of type `IEvent`
just to access the event metadata.

Below is a small example of accessing event metadata during aggregation:

<!-- snippet: sample_aggregation_using_event_metadata -->
<a id='snippet-sample_aggregation_using_event_metadata'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    // Access event metadata through IEvent<T>
    public Trip Create(IEvent<TripStarted> @event)
    {
        var trip = new Trip
        {
            Id = @event.StreamId, // Marten does this for you anyway
            Started = @event.Timestamp,
            CorrelationId = @event.Timestamp, // Open telemetry type tracing
            Description = @event.Data.Description // Still access to the event body
        };

        // Use a custom header
        if (@event.Headers.TryGetValue("customer", out var customerId))
        {
            trip.CustomerId = (string)customerId;
        }

        return trip;
    }

    public void Apply(TripEnded ended, Trip trip, IEvent @event)
    {
        trip.Ended = @event.Timestamp;
    }

    // Other Apply/ShouldDelete methods

    public override ValueTask RaiseSideEffects(IDocumentOperations operations, IEventSlice<Trip> slice)
    {
        // Emit other events or messages during asynchronous projection
        // processing

        // Access to the current state as of the projection
        // event page being processed *right* now
        var currentTrip = slice.Aggregate;

        if (currentTrip.TotalMiles > 1000)
        {
            // Append a new event to this stream
            slice.AppendEvent(new PassedThousandMiles());

            // Append a new event to a different event stream by
            // first specifying a different stream id
            slice.AppendEvent(currentTrip.InsuranceCompanyId, new IncrementThousandMileTrips());

            // "Publish" outgoing messages when the event page is successfully committed
            slice.PublishMessage(new SendCongratulationsOnLongTrip(currentTrip.Id));

            // And yep, you can make additional changes to Marten
            operations.Store(new CompletelyDifferentDocument
            {
                Name = "New Trip Segment",
                OriginalTripId = currentTrip.Id
            });
        }

        // This usage has to be async in case you're
        // doing any additional data access with the
        // Marten operations
        return new ValueTask();
    }
}
```

## Working with Event Metadata <Badge type="tip" text="7.12" />

::: info
As of Marten 7.33, this mechanism executes for every single event in the current event slice in order.
:::

At any point in an `Apply()` or `Create()` or `ShouldDelete()` method, you can take in either the generic `IEvent` wrapper
or the specific `IEvent<T>` wrapper type for the specific event. _Sometimes_ though, you may want to automatically tag your
aggregated document with metadata from applied events. _If_ you are using
either `SingleStreamProjection<T>` or `MultiStreamProjection<TDoc, TId>` as the base class for a projection, you can 
override the `ApplyMetadata(T aggregate, IEvent lastEvent)` method in your projection to manually map event metadata to 
your aggregate in any way you wish.

Here's an example of using a custom header value of the events captured to update an aggregate based on the last event encountered:

<!-- snippet: sample_using_ApplyMetadata -->
<a id='snippet-sample_using_applymetadata'></a>
```cs
public class Item
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public bool Started { get; set; }
    public DateTimeOffset WorkedOn { get; set; }
    public bool Completed { get; set; }
    public string LastModifiedBy { get; set; }
    public DateTimeOffset? LastModified { get; set; }

    public int Version { get; set; }
}

public record ItemStarted(string Description);

public record ItemWorked;

public record ItemFinished;

public class ItemProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Item>
{
    public void Apply(Item item, ItemStarted started)
    {
        item.Started = true;
        item.Description = started.Description;
    }

    public void Apply(Item item, IEvent<ItemWorked> worked)
    {
        // Nothing, I know, this is weird
    }

    public void Apply(Item item, ItemFinished finished)
    {
        item.Completed = true;
    }

    public override Item ApplyMetadata(Item aggregate, IEvent lastEvent)
    {
        // Apply the last timestamp
        aggregate.LastModified = lastEvent.Timestamp;

        var person = lastEvent.GetHeader("last-modified-by");

        aggregate.LastModifiedBy = person?.ToString() ?? "System";

        return aggregate;
    }
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

And the same projection in usage in a unit test to see how it's all put together:

<!-- snippet: sample_apply_metadata -->
<a id='snippet-sample_apply_metadata'></a>
```cs
[Fact]
public async Task apply_metadata()
{
    StoreOptions(opts =>
    {
        opts.Projections.Add<ItemProjection>(ProjectionLifecycle.Inline);

        // THIS IS NECESSARY FOR THIS SAMPLE!
        opts.Events.MetadataConfig.HeadersEnabled = true;
    });

    // Setting a header value on the session, which will get tagged on each
    // event captured by the current session
    theSession.SetHeader("last-modified-by", "Glenn Frey");

    var id = theSession.Events.StartStream<Item>(new ItemStarted("Blue item")).Id;
    await theSession.SaveChangesAsync();

    theSession.Events.Append(id, new ItemWorked(), new ItemWorked(), new ItemFinished());
    await theSession.SaveChangesAsync();

    var item = await theSession.LoadAsync<Item>(id);

    // RIP Glenn Frey, take it easy!
    item.LastModifiedBy.ShouldBe("Glenn Frey");
    item.Version.ShouldBe(4);
}
```

## Raising Events, Messages, or other Operations in Aggregation Projections <Badge type="tip" text="7.27" />

Man, that's a mouthful of a title. _Sometimes_, it can be valuable to emit new events during the processing of a projection
when you first know the new state of the projected aggregate documents. Or maybe what you might want to do is to send
a message for the new state of an updated projection. Here's a couple possible scenarios that might lead you here:

- There's some kind of business logic that can be processed against an aggregate to "decide" what the system can do next
- You need to send updates about the aggregated projection state to clients via web sockets
- You need to replicate the Marten projection data in a completely different database
- There are business processes that can be kicked off for updates to the aggregated state

To do any of this, you can override the `RaiseSideEffects()` method in any aggregated projection that uses one of the 
following base classes:

1. `SingleStreamProjection`
2. `MultiStreamProjection`
3. `CustomStreamProjection`

Here's an example of that method overridden in a projection:

<!-- snippet: sample_aggregation_using_event_metadata -->
<a id='snippet-sample_aggregation_using_event_metadata'></a>
```cs
public class TripProjection: SingleStreamProjection<Trip>
{
    // Access event metadata through IEvent<T>
    public Trip Create(IEvent<TripStarted> @event)
    {
        var trip = new Trip
        {
            Id = @event.StreamId, // Marten does this for you anyway
            Started = @event.Timestamp,
            CorrelationId = @event.Timestamp, // Open telemetry type tracing
            Description = @event.Data.Description // Still access to the event body
        };

        // Use a custom header
        if (@event.Headers.TryGetValue("customer", out var customerId))
        {
            trip.CustomerId = (string)customerId;
        }

        return trip;
    }

    public void Apply(TripEnded ended, Trip trip, IEvent @event)
    {
        trip.Ended = @event.Timestamp;
    }

    // Other Apply/ShouldDelete methods

    public override ValueTask RaiseSideEffects(IDocumentOperations operations, IEventSlice<Trip> slice)
    {
        // Emit other events or messages during asynchronous projection
        // processing

        // Access to the current state as of the projection
        // event page being processed *right* now
        var currentTrip = slice.Aggregate;

        if (currentTrip.TotalMiles > 1000)
        {
            // Append a new event to this stream
            slice.AppendEvent(new PassedThousandMiles());

            // Append a new event to a different event stream by
            // first specifying a different stream id
            slice.AppendEvent(currentTrip.InsuranceCompanyId, new IncrementThousandMileTrips());

            // "Publish" outgoing messages when the event page is successfully committed
            slice.PublishMessage(new SendCongratulationsOnLongTrip(currentTrip.Id));

            // And yep, you can make additional changes to Marten
            operations.Store(new CompletelyDifferentDocument
            {
                Name = "New Trip Segment",
                OriginalTripId = currentTrip.Id
            });
        }

        // This usage has to be async in case you're
        // doing any additional data access with the
        // Marten operations
        return new ValueTask();
    }
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

A couple important facts about this new functionality:

- The `RaiseSideEffects()` method is only called during _continuous_ asynchronous projection execution, and will not
  be called during projection rebuilds or `Inline` projection usage
- Events emitted during the side effect method are _not_ immediately applied to the current projected document value by Marten
- You _can_ alter the aggregate value or replace it yourself in this side effect method to reflect new events, but the onus
  is on you the user to apply idempotent updates to the aggregate based on these new events in the actual handlers for
  the new events when those events are handled by the daemon in a later batch
- There is a [Wolverine](https://wolverinefx.net) integration (of course) to publish the messages through Wolverine if using the `AddMarten()IntegrateWithWolverine()` option

This relatively new behavior that was built for a specific [JasperFx Software](https://jasperfx.net) client project, 
but has been on the backlog for quite some time. If there are any difficulties with this approach, please feel free
to join the [Marten Discord room](https://discord.gg/BGkCDx5d).
