# Explicit Aggregations

::: warning
The recipe in this documentation section is perfect for complicated projection lifecycles, but does not always play
nicely with Marten's `AggregateStreamAsync()` API. We recommend using `FetchLatest()` with this projection recipe
for read only access.
:::

The original concept for Marten projections was the conventional method model (`Apply()` / `Create()` / `ShouldDelete()` methods), but we
quickly found out that the workflow generated from these methods just isn't sufficient for many user needs. At the same time,
other users just prefer explicit code anyway, so Marten provides the `CustomProjection<TDoc, TId>` base class as a way to 
configure custom projections that use explicit code for the actual work of building projected, aggregate documents from
raw events.

Alright, let's jump right into an example. Two of the drivers for this feature were for aggregations to document types that were [soft-deleted](/documents/deletes.html#soft-deletes) or aggregations where some events should only apply to the aggregate document if the document already existed. To illustrate this with a contrived example, let's say that we've got these event types:

<!-- snippet: sample_custom_aggregate_events -->
<a id='snippet-sample_custom_aggregate_events'></a>
```cs
public class Start
{
}

public class End
{
}

public class Restart
{
}

public class Increment
{
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

And a simple aggregate document type like this:

<!-- snippet: sample_StartAndStopAggregate -->
<a id='snippet-sample_startandstopaggregate'></a>
```cs
public class StartAndStopAggregate: ISoftDeleted
{
    public int Count { get; set; }

    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    // These are Marten controlled
    public bool Deleted { get; set; }
    public DateTimeOffset? DeletedAt { get; set; }

    public void Increment()
    {
        Count++;
    }
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

As you can see, `StartAndStopAggregate` as a `Guid` as its identity and is also [soft-deleted](/documents/deletes.html#soft-deletes) when stored by
Marten by virtue of implementing the `ISoftDeleted` interface.

With all that being done, here's a sample aggregation that inherits from the Marten `Marten.Events.Aggregation.CustomAggregation<TDoc, TId>` base class:

<!-- snippet: sample_custom_aggregate_with_start_and_stop -->
<a id='snippet-sample_custom_aggregate_with_start_and_stop'></a>
```cs
public class StartAndStopProjection: CustomProjection<StartAndStopAggregate, Guid>
{
    public StartAndStopProjection()
    {
        // I'm telling Marten that events are assigned to the aggregate
        // document by the stream id
        AggregateByStream();

        // This is an optional, but potentially important optimization
        // for the async daemon so that it sets up an allow list
        // of the event types that will be run through this projection
        IncludeType<Start>();
        IncludeType<End>();
        IncludeType<Restart>();
        IncludeType<Increment>();
    }

    public override ValueTask ApplyChangesAsync(DocumentSessionBase session,
        EventSlice<StartAndStopAggregate, Guid> slice, CancellationToken cancellation,
        ProjectionLifecycle lifecycle = ProjectionLifecycle.Inline)
    {
        var aggregate = slice.Aggregate;

        foreach (var data in slice.AllData())
        {
            switch (data)
            {
                case Start:
                    aggregate = new StartAndStopAggregate
                    {
                        // Have to assign the identity ourselves
                        Id = slice.Id
                    };
                    break;
                case Increment when aggregate is { Deleted: false }:
                    // Use explicit code to only apply this event
                    // if the aggregate already exists
                    aggregate.Increment();
                    break;
                case End when aggregate is { Deleted: false }:
                    // This will be a "soft delete" because the aggregate type
                    // implements the IDeleted interface
                    session.Delete(aggregate);
                    aggregate.Deleted = true; // Got to help Marten out a little bit here
                    break;
                case Restart when aggregate == null || aggregate.Deleted:
                    // Got to "undo" the soft delete status
                    session
                        .UndoDeleteWhere<StartAndStopAggregate>(x => x.Id == slice.Id);
                    break;
            }
        }

        // THIS IS IMPORTANT. *IF* you want to use a CustomProjection with
        // AggregateStreamAsync(), you must make this call
        // FetchLatest() will work w/o any other changes though
        slice.Aggregate = aggregate;

        // Apply any updates!
        if (aggregate != null)
        {
            session.Store(aggregate);
        }

        // We didn't do anything that required an asynchronous call
        return new ValueTask();
    }
}
```

## Custom Grouping

All aggregations in Marten come in two parts:

1. _Grouping_ incoming events into "slices" of events that should be applied to an aggregate by id
2. _Applying_ incoming events from each slice into the identified aggregate

`CustomAggregate` supports aggregating by the stream identity as shown above. You can also use all the same customizable grouping functionality as
the older [MultiStreamProjection](/events/projections/multi-stream-projections) subclass.

## Simple Workflows <Badge type="tip" text="7.28" />

The base class can be used for strictly live aggregations. If all you're doing is using this
mechanism for `Live` aggregation, or have a simple workflow where the aggregate is always
going to be built strictly from the event data, you can override _only_ the `Apply()` method 
as shown below:

<!-- snippet: sample_using_simple_explicit_code_for_live_aggregation -->
<a id='snippet-sample_using_simple_explicit_code_for_live_aggregation'></a>
```cs
public class ExplicitCounter: CustomProjection<SimpleAggregate, Guid>
{
    public override SimpleAggregate Apply(SimpleAggregate snapshot, IReadOnlyList<IEvent> events)
    {
        snapshot ??= new SimpleAggregate();
        foreach (var e in events.Select(x => x.Data))
        {
            if (e is AEvent) snapshot.ACount++;
            if (e is BEvent) snapshot.BCount++;
            if (e is CEvent) snapshot.CCount++;
            if (e is DEvent) snapshot.DCount++;
        }

        // You have to explicitly return the new value
        // of the aggregated document no matter what!
        return snapshot;
    }
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

Note that this usage is valid for all possible projection lifecycles now (`Live`, `Inline`, and `Async`).
